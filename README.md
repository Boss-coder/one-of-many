Mean while can properly structure task moving forward 
and actually make them available, I had to get information from others 
About the task, that's not the best at all and the teaching mehn. The teaching was like 
Saying 1+1= 2 and setting accessment for (x + z² × 46 ) where x is the coefficient of 7 .
Not the best at alll.
